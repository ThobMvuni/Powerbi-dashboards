# African Insurance Industry Analysis - PowerBI Dashboard

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Introduction
The African insurance industry faces significant challenges in customer penetration, despite Africa representing 17% of the global population. Major barriers include inefficient pricing strategies, high unemployment rates, and a general lack of public understanding of insurance products. These issues hinder customer acquisition, resulting in unprofitable claims handling and high customer attrition.

This project aims to address these challenges by analyzing a comprehensive insurance dataset. By leveraging historical data, we intend to identify key trends and develop predictive models to improve both customer acquisition and claims management processes.

### 1.1.1 Problem Statement
Africa's insurance industry has a low customer base relative to its population size. Contributing factors include:

- Inefficient pricing strategies that do not account for economic disparities (e.g., unemployment).
- Limited public knowledge about insurance and its benefits, leading to poor claims utilization.

Our goal is to analyze market dynamics and claims data to better understand these barriers and develop predictive models that will help insurers optimize both customer acquisition and claims processes.

### 1.1.2 Aim
The project aims to deliver data-driven insights and solutions to improve customer penetration and claims efficiency within the African insurance industry. By analyzing key demographic, economic, and insurance claim data, the project aims to provide actionable strategies that can assist insurers in enhancing decision-making and driving market growth.

### 1.1.3 Objectives
- **Analyze demographic and economic factors** influencing insurance uptake across Africa.
- **Study claim patterns** to identify trends in claim frequency, approval rates, and risk factors.
- **Develop predictive models** to forecast customer churn and identify high-risk claims.
- **Offer recommendations** to optimize pricing strategies and educate customers on making effective claims.

## 2. Project Structure

### 2.1 Data
The project utilizes historical insurance datasets, which include:
- Customer demographics
- Policy details
- Claim history
- Economic indicators

These datasets have been cleaned and prepared for analysis to ensure accuracy.

### 2.2 Methodology

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The dataset will be explored to uncover initial trends and patterns related to customer behavior, claims, and pricing strategies.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Machine learning models will be developed to predict customer churn, high-risk claims, and optimal pricing strategies.
- **Recommendation System:** Insights and models will be translated into actionable recommendations to improve customer acquisition, retention, and claims handling.

### 2.3 PowerBI Dashboards
The PowerBI dashboards visualize key metrics, trends, and insights derived from the dataset, including:
- **Customer Acquisition Trends**
- **Claims Analysis**
- **Risk Factor Visualizations**
